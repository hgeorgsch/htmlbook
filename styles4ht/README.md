1. Main package: htmlbook.sty and .4ht

This provides the core functionality, including several companion
packages:
- theorem.sty and .4ht
- thmbox.sty
- figurefix.cfg
- listingsfix.cfg
- plainhtml.sty and .4ht

2.  Hidden solutions: facit.sty

This is a very simple package providing the macro \fasit to set
text which is normally hidden in HTML but displays on mouse over.
Analogous PDF functionality has not been implemented yet.

3.  Include video

This is still rather rudimentary.  Currently I use
newtalk.sty which includes talk.sty.
