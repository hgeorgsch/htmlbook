# HTMLBOOK

## What is it?

HTMLBOOK is a template to create web pages from LaTeX sources, with the
table of contents as a left hand menu.  Documents are compiled with TeX4ht.

## Does it work?

It is highly experimental, but it works for me.  

Bug reports and tips to make it more robust are welcome.

**User Documentation:** Sorry, read the source.

## Installation:

### The TeX4ht config:

The toc.cfg file must be availble to the tex4ht compiler.  The easiest
is probably to copy it into the working directory of your document.

### TeX and TeX4ht Styles:

The styles4ht directory must be placed in the texmf search path,
one way or another. The easiest is probably to include it in the
TEXINPUTS environment variable.

### CSS styles:
